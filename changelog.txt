2.4.4.2
Bug fixes:
- fixed a bug that was causing consistent crashes when the player was inflicted with dominance addiction (may affect other addictions too)

2.4.4.1
Bug fixes:
- Typos (reports courtesy of dndw)
- Actually implemented the Piercing Odor trait
- Untamed now only flips sexual positions when you are in a submissive position.
	- Also increase chance to 25%

2.4.4
New:
- Added specializations for Kat.
	- Added 18 new traits for her.
- Generalized some scenes for girls and herms.
- You can now convince NPCs to get male genitalia when they have reached level 10 and you have a good relationship with them during the day time.
- Merged in logicK's hard mode "both specializations" choices and added some new scenes for them.
	- Picking the "[Hard Mode]" choices will make the character drastically more difficult to fight against. They will gain both traits for specializations as well as an additional trait point per level.
	- Picking hard mode choices will also give you two additional trait points, one immediately and one at a higher level.
- Merged in ThresholdFromBeyond's Titfuck/Breast Smother changes.
	- I did nerf BreastSmother a bit though, since draining 10% of your willpower per use was a bit too much...
- Merged in other body part fetish weaknesses (forgot who added this one, if it was you, please speak up :D)
	- Breast Obsessed
	- Ass addict
	- Pussy Whipped
	- Cock Craver
- Added an ExpRate to the start menu to choose how fast the game goes.
		- Slow is about 70% of the previous exp rate 
		- Normal is about 150% of the previous exp rate
		- Fast is about 225% of the previous exp rate
		- Very Fast is about 450% of the previous exp rate
	- Warning: High exp rates can have weird consequences. It is not well tested, so I cannot vouch for what will happen.
- Added a Fast Combat Display option to the options menu
	- Selecting this will bring back the old behaviour of not pressing next after each combat action
- Added more messages for the opponent when they are cumming or when you are cumming (depends on how many orgasms they or you had)

Balance changes:
- Buffed Kat's maximum arousal and arousal growth.
- Nerfed pheromones so that it does not stack infinitely. Now pheromones can only stack up to 5 times per unique source
	- Pheromone can stack up to 10 times if the applier has the "Complex Aroma" trait
- Further nerfed non-character pets. (Fairies were pleasuring people for 100 arousal at like level 15... :\)
- Made certain short disables not give you the wary buff. This will buff Jewel because her short stuns will not make you invulnerable to disables for 3+ turns.
- Made nymphomania + feral not always trigger. Instead nymphomania will use the nymphomania + animism attributes to determine trigger chance.
- Made status multipliers for pleasure additive with other multipliers (they now factor into sensitivity) instead of having it be multiplicative with the other bonuses.
	- This nerfs fetishes at higher levels.
		- This was done after having a medium ass fetish and getting Spiral'd by Jewel. Did over 3000 pleasure damage... wtf
- Lowered transformation costs for collectable items from Angel, Reyka, Kat and Jewel
- Changed how sneaking works
	- When moving, characters have a chance of detecting each other.
	- Base detection difficulty = Cunning / 4 - (opponent's perception * 2)
	- If you are hiding, difficulty +=  (20 + Cunning * 3 / 4)
	- If you have the trait sneaky, difficulty + 20
	- Roll a d20, if your cunning + roll(d20) > difficulty, then you succeed in detecting the opponent.
		- if you roll 1, you critical miss and always fail in detection
		- if you roll 20, you critical hit and always succeed in detection
- Rebalanced Kiss
	- Kiss now has a higher accuracy rate and higher unmodified base damage
	- However now Kiss becomes stale much faster, and can has a lower floor (down to 25% of base effectiveness).
- Thrust/fucking skills in general now have lower staleness increases.
- Thrust/Ride now is less random
- Grind damage up a tiny bit
- Piston damage up a tiny bit
- Trip and Maneuver now has a 1 turn cooldown.
- Being stunned no longer drastically reduces your pleasure taken (still reduces temptation damage taken though)

	- This is mostly done so you don't get spammed with messages.
- Shameless no longer blocks flatfooted
- Reduced willpower loss from overflow arousal to 25 * %overflow (from 50 * % overflow)

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed pull out not working
- Fixed some skill related bugs that was making things unintentionally usable and unusable in certain situations.

- You will no longer orgasm from being pleasure earlier during the turn but and tempted afterwards
- Fixed a bug where the insertion helps your opponents instead of you. Woops.

Minor:

- Removed asexual from the starting genders because it's very unsupported and you're much more likely to run into bugs with this.

2.4.3.2

- Fixed a label issue with the clothing change UI (both the closet and the current outfit were being labeld closet)

2.4.3
Balance:

- Biological damage modifiers have been halved (affects pheromones and sedate)
- Biological defense now includes attributes in Seduction as well as Cunning/Science/Bio/Animism.
- Knockdowns now has a new formula so that having over 300 stamina doesn't just make you immune to knockdowns.

- Hawkeye
	- +5% accuracy
- Tempting Tits

2.3.2
Bug fixes:

- Fixed a bug where any starts loaded after futanari time would fail to appear (extra comma in the json, guessing dndw fixed it but forgot to push)
- Fixed a bug where Yui would join the game even though she's only half implemented. Woops.

2.3.1
Bug fixes:
- Fixed a crash bug related to tentacles.
	- Unfortunately this does change it a bit, in that it will use the character's stats in calculating pleasure damage whereas before it was using a dummy tentacles character. Oh well.
- Fixed a crash bug related to the Glamour skill
- Fixed a bug that caused AI opponents not to evaluate tickle and slap as stamina damage.
- Stunned now 3 -> 2 turns and winded lasts 3-4 -> 4 turns.
- Fixed a bug where characters will equip random clothing they own upon loading from a save. This removes compatibility with SUPER old saves. If you're using like < 1.9 saves, well, don't :P
- Fixed a bunch of typos and grammar issues. I swear writing for nightgames is like doing madlibs...
- Fixed a bug where Footjob strategy would cause the user to do squats. (repeatedly stand up and mount you)

	- Requires 24 Ninjutsu (so basically no one is going to use this yet)
- Added a new arcane skill Glamour which increases the "hotness" multiplier for arousal damage by 2.0. Requires 6 arcane.

Balance changes:
- Changed how stamina works.
	- Now all sources of healing is much less than before, so stamina damage will stick a bit more.
	- Nerfed exercised and porn to give 1-2 points without fitness nut/expert googler, 2-4 with the perks.
		- You can now only achieve a maximum of 100 + level * 8 arousal, and 100 + level * 5 stamina through training.
			Hopefully this stops the stat ballooning at end game where you can just spam porn and have > 2000 maximum arousal.
	- Taking points in power (and to a lesser extent cunning) will now both increase the amount of hurt you do, and the amount of stamina loss you get from taking damage.

	- Being stunned/winded will reduce pleasure damage taken by 50%.
	- Having a point in Divinity will upgrade the braced status after getting up, increasing the damage reduction and extending it to 6 turns.
	- Shield now lasts for 7 turns (up from 4).
	- Increased the pain threshold for reducing arousal from 4% up to 16.66%
- Points in cunning will now decrease the amount of damage from toys taken as well as increasing damage dealt. Science will also increase toys damage, but will not add to defence.
- Points in dark and arcane will increase the amount of drain damage dealt and decreased drain damage received.
- Points in Bio/Animism/Science/Medicine will improve biological damage. So far this is limited to pheromones and aphrodisiacs. The same attributes will reduce damage from them with the addition of cunning to a lesser extent.
- Mara now has a new perk "Deft hands" at 33 that increases her pleasure damage with hands by a flat 2-5.
- Mara now has a new perk "Nimble toes" at 42 that increases her pleasure damage with feet by a flat 2-5.
- Mara now has a new perk "Toymaster" at 36 that increases her skill effectiveness with toys.

2.0.1 changelog
Bug fixes:
- Fixed a ton of Airi specific bugs (thanks dndw)
- Fixed a bug where being at 0 willpower will make the AI always want to keep you there (hey, since they're at 0 willpower, I don't want to make them cum because that would lower their arousal right? RIGHT?)

- Fixed a bug where characters with the nymphomania Trait (looking at you Kat...) would never lose because nymphomania restored willpower to at least 10 after every orgasm... Woops.
- Fixed a bug where the portrait would disappear.
	- This actually reworked the GUI code a bit, so you may see some weirdness at first. Please report it and I'll try to fix it asap.
- Fixed a bug where characters with the immobile Trait would never resupply. (not heavily tested however, so please report if it's doing something weird)
- Set the colors of the closet UI to be in line with the main UI

- Wild Thrust's base damage is now increased by your current arousal / 30, up to your maximum Animism

Balance:
- Reduced Airi's starting willpower from 500 to 150.
	- Increased her willpower growth to 5 per level, since it's actually kind of cool that she has a ridiculously high will power for a contestant.
- Wear Strapon now has a 6 turn cooldown, so you cannot just spam it	
- Bluff and Determination now has a minimum calming effect of 20.
- Mystery NPC:
	- Added trait unnatural growth:
		- Always 5 levels higher than the highest level player, not counting anyone with natural growth or unnatural growth.
	- Added trait Enchanting Voice
		- Once every (2 + level difference / 5) turns, starting on turn 2, she gets a free command (same effect as the one in enthrall).
	- Made both LewdSuggestion and HeightenSenses usable when the target is not charmed, but they have a 1/3 chance of failing.
	- Gave her per level stat growths

- Added courtyard to the map, and a bit of description to make it connected with the pool.

	- Having an empty bottle in your inventory and defeating a girl with pussy mods can give you some cool new items.

- Removed petite requirement from Pounce (NICE SKILL YOU HAVE THERE, KAT. SHAME YOU CAN'T USE IT)

1.8.2 changelog

Features:
- Clothing has been completely overhauled.
	- All clothing will be in the resources/clothing/
		- new clothing can be either added to the existing json file or it can be a new json file in that directory
	- Got rid of the old skimpiness system and replaced it with exposure.
		- All clothing have an exposure value, that is multiplied together to get your final exposure level for that slot (top or bottom)
			- Example: you're wearing panties, a skirt, a bra, and a blouse
				- panties exposure: .8
				- skirt exposure: .4
				- Total bottom exposure = .8 * .4 = .32
				- bra exposure: .8
				- blouse exposure: .3
				- Total top exposure = .3 * .8 = .24
				- Overall body exposure = (.24 + .32) / 2 = .28
			- This body exposure value increases your body's hotness stat (in this case by .28%), which in turn affects tempt and pleasure damage you do
		- To counteract the fact that wearing clothing reduces your body hotness stat, clothing now have a hotness stat as well
			- This directly adds to the hotness stat of your body while you have it on, but is reduced by the exposure level of the layers above it.
				- Example: you have a bra and a tshirt on
					- bra hotness: .4
					- tshirt hotness: .1
					- tshirt exposure: .4
					- total hotness = .1 (Tshirt) + .4(Bra) * .4(Tshirt exposure) = .26
					- If you strip off the tshirt,
					- total hotness = .4 (Bra)
			- Note that these values probably will change since I'm just trying to pick values that make sense right now
			- Hopefully this encourages people to keep their clothing on at least some of the time instead of stripping both naked within the first 2 turns.
	- Redid the mapping of the clothing. Now certain clothing can take two slots and cover both top and bottom (like trench coat and cloak)
		- top layers:
			- 0 : undershirt/bra
			- 1 : none
			- 2 : shirt/dresses
			- 3 : jackets/coats
			- 4 : cloaks etc
		- bottom layers:
			- 0 : underwear/panties
			- 1 : hosiery/leg warmers
			- 2 : pants/skirts/dresses
			- 3 : coats etc
			- 4 : cloaks etc
		- legs layer:
			- 1 : hosiery/leg warmers
			- 2 : pants
		- feet layer:
			- 1 : hosiery/leg warmers/socks
			- 2 : shoes
		- arms layer:
			- 1 : gloves
		- head layer:
			- unused for now (hats?)
		- hands layer:
			- 1 : gloves
			- 3 : unused for now (rings?)
		- neck layer:
			- unused for now (necklaces? collars?)
	- Stripping works a bit differently as well
		- Strip skills and Tear skills only shred top and bottom.
		- Random strip skills (Dissolving solution) strip any slot at random
		- Nudification skills (Defabricator, Nakedbloom, etc) will first strip top and bottom, and then strip the rest if used again.
	- Added a ton of new clothing.
		- Most of these can be found in the Boutique, Clothing Shop, or XXX Store.
		- Hover over the clothing in the store or the clothing change UI to see what they do.
	- Unfortunately this may mean that your saves are no longer compatible.
		- NEVERMIND, I MADE THEM COMPATIBLE :D
- When NPCs have affections over 30, you can give them gifts (Clothing)
	- When they have over 35 affection, they'll let you pick out their wardrobe.
	- Note that you can really screw them over by picking harmful outfits. Discretion advised.
- Added a new character initial strength Trait:
	- "Stable Form"
		- Prevents the effects of Priapus Draft, FemDraft, Tiny Draft, Bust Draft, Succubus Draft and Tentacle Tonic from applying when thrown at you.
- Added two new character initial weakness Traits:
	- "Naive"
		- 50% to not get cynical after recovering from a mindgame status (enthralled, trance, flatfooted, etc)
	- "Foot Fetishist"
		- Starts each match with a foot fetish at the minimum magnitude
- Added new Traits:
	- Heels Pro:
		- Wearing heels does not reduce your speed, and does not make you easily knocked down (generally heels have higher hotness bonuses)
	- Heels Master:
		- While wearing heels, you have a 33% chance to avoid knockdowns (Tackle, Trip, Shove, etc)
	- You gain Heels Training after finishing a battle with heels on.
		- One for heels
		- Two total for high heels
		- Three total for higher heels (Stiletto Pumps)
	- Heels Pro = 50 total training
	- Heels Master = 100 total training
- Merged in some foot fetish content from Sakruff (Thanks!)
	- Updated text on foot job/foot pump to have events for girls
	- Added a new skill Foot Smother
		- Unlocks at 20 Fetish
		- Can be used when shoeless and you are standing over the opponent
		- Has a raised chance to inflict foot fetish
- If you start off as a female or a herm, you start with bra and panties instead of boxers.
	- If you start off as a female or a herm, you start off with b cup breasts (up from flat)
- Changed the AI:
	- The AI now will consider the opponent differently. This mainly makes it so that more interesting things can be added.
	- The AI now will pick the best item to drink/throw instead of a completely random item.
	- The AI now will take the male preference slider into account when determining what move is good
		- Example: You have male preference slide all the way to the right.
				   The AI will consider growing a cock good and you getting a pussy good.
	- This is a bit experimental at the moment, so please let me know if something seems off.

Balance:
- Made divine pussy's divine charge stack double every time she takes pleasure damage instead of increasing it by .25
	- Makes getting out of vaginal penetration very important versus Angel
- Made enthrall stack less.
	- When enthralled status is added on to a already enthralled opponent, the final duration will be whatever is more:
		- Original duration + 1
		- New duration - 2 * (number of times this enthralled status has been refreshed + 1)
	- Note: If you are still having trouble with enthrall, try speccing more into Cunning.
- Fetishes now last throughout a match, but decrease in magnitude as time passes to a minimum magnitude of .25
	- Being pleasured by the fetish part will increase magnitude by .05
- Kiss of Baptism has been rebalanced a bit.
	- It now costs 30 mojo instead of building 10 mojo.
	- Now always applies Love Struck, but only for 2 turns
	- Now builds you 50% mojo
	- Now fully heals you
	- Buffed base damage bonus to 20

- Logs now also show status effects being added and removed
- Latex clothing has been removed from the Boutique (it's purchasable in the XXX shop)

1.8.1 changelog

Major changes:
- A lot of different body modifications have been moved to specific characters. The player must build a relationship with them in order to get the mods.
	- Example: to get a succubus pussy or an incubus cock, you must have enough affection with Reyka in order to obtain it.
	There are new transformation scenes for getting each body part modification, but a lot of them are placeholds right now (Only Reyka has some finished scenes at the moment)
- Cock mods that dndw added has been refactored so that they count as modifications and not cock types. This means that you can grow and shrink them like normal.
	- Note: This was a lot more work than I originally thought, and I had to change how the BodyPart systems worked.
		Don't be too surprised to see some bugs until thing stabilize again.
		On the bright side though, it will be MUCH easier to add new types of BodyPart modifications in the future.
	- NPCs will also mod their cocks when they get one (note that it may take them a day to do it)
- Angel has been somewhat rewritten. Her upgraded class and attribute (Succubus/Dark) overlaps with Reyka too much.
	- Angel's upgraded class is now Demigoddess and preferred attribute is Divinity
		- Her level up traits have been updated to reflect this.
			- level 18 Semenphage -> Erophage (Feeds on sexuality, gains mojo/Alluring status when opponent orgasms)
			- level 33 Energydrain -> level 36 Object of Worship (Opponents is periodically forced to worship her body)
			- level 36 RawSexuality -> level 33
		- Her pussy mod has been changed from succubus to divine
			- Every time her pussy is pleasured while fucking, gain a stacking pleasure bonus. This resets when you pull out.
				Example: base divine pussy pleasureMod is 1.0
					1. You use thrust, pleasureMod bonus of +.25 = 1.25
					2. She uses ride, pleasureMod bonus of +.25 = 1.5
	- Changed the blessed cock mod to align with the Divinity Attribute and Angel. Cassie now offers the Runic cock mod instead.

Bug fix:
- Refracted Status duration, hopefully this will solve issues where statuses were not being cleared in the right order
- Fixed a bug where if both combatants had both male and female genitalia, pussy would always take priority when fucking. (It will be random for now)
	- Note that this opens up a lot more stances that weren't working before, so you may see a lot of missing/incorrect text when an unexpected situation comes up.
	- I suspect that you'll see a lot of weirdness with struggle. The effect should still work, but you might see text that wont make sense.
- Fixed a bug where loading the game could clear the malepref slider value

Balance:
- Fire form now weakens by 5 a turn instead of 1 a turn. Should still be really good.
- Flatfooted now gives you Wary after it ends instead of Cynical. (seems to make more sense)
- Nimble now gives you 2 bonus speed as well as some bonus evade based on Animism
- Flick now has a 3 turn cooldown, but causes opponent to lose 25 mojo
- Focus now reduces arousal by 20% of the cap or 20, whatever is more. It also now builds 25% Mojo. However now it has a 2 turn cooldown.
- Footjob and Foot Pump now have a base 15% chance to cause a Foot Fetish (up from 5%). This is still increased by 2% per Fetish attribute.
- Frottage now has a base 15% chance to cause a Cock Fetish (up from 5%). This is still increased by 2% per Fetish attribute.
- Assfuck now only requires 15 Seduction (down from 20)
- Sex Counter now requires 20 Seduction (up from 15)
- Grind now builds 10% Mojo (up from 5%)
- Invitation now requires 25 Seduction (up from 15), but now costs 30 Mojo (down from 50)
- Capped Kick damage at Random[0-12] + min(100, Power)
- Capped Knee damage at 4 + Random[0-11] + min(50, Power), fixed a bug where having achilles would not add bonus power.
- Capped Magic Missile damage at 100.
- Level Drain now requires 50 Dark (I see why SilverBard disabled this now...)
- Use Breasts now requires at least C cup breasts, but does not exclude Petite
- Sacrifice now costs 20 Mojo (down from 40)
- Submissive Hold now requires 15 Seduction and 15 Power (Up from 10 Seduction only)
- Tail Peg now requires 1 Dark OR 20 Seduction (changed from 2 Dark only)
- Tail Peg now continuously fucks your opponent with your tail if done while already in a sex stance
- Tail Peg now has text for players using it

New:
- Added the Trait Insertion Master (better name needed)
	- Increases base pleasure damage of fucking (but not thrusting/grinding/etc) by min(seduction / 4, 40)
	- Angel gets this trait at 24 and Reyka at 17
	- Players can get it after getting the Powerful hips trait
- Added skills LivingClothing: Self and LivingClothing: Other
	- This skill is usable with 15 science, and clothes either yourself or the opponent with tentacles.
	- The only difference between the two other than the target is that the ones for the opponent is ineffective (does not block fucking etc)
	- Tentacle clothing does arousal damage every turn.
	- LivingClothing: Other can only be done while holding the opponent down

Other changes:
- Status panel now hides items that you have 0 of.
- Characters now have to be pleasured before they orgasm. Temptation damage is no longer sufficient
- lowered AI priority of stand up
- Changed how statuses's resource modifiers stacked
	- Multiple statuses used to stack multiplicatively
		(if you had 50% pain reduction from one status, and 50% from another, it would be 25%)
	- Now stacks additively (50% + 50% = 100% reduction)
- Changed Edging to Surrender to better reflect what it does
- Added willpower to the perception stats
